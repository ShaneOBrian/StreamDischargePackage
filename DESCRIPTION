Description: This package provides a function for calculating stream discharge using depth, 
  width, and velocity inputs. Stream discharge, representing the volume of water moving down 
  a stream or river per unit of time, is a crucial parameter for various hydrological studies 
  and applications including flood prediction, water resource management, and environmental 
  research. The calculation is based on the principle that discharge can be computed by 
  multiplying the cross-sectional area of the stream (depth x width) by the average velocity 
  of water flow.
